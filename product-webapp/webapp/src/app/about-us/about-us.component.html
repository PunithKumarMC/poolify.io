            We made carpooling easier than ever. Sharing a carpool is a great way to travel. 
            It's <b>affordable, comfortable and eco-friendly! </b>If you're driving with an empty car, 
            consider publishing a carpool ride on <b> P-o-o-lify </b> to save costs and travel with some company. 
            Our community of carpoolers is the most trustworthy in the world.

            <h2 class="text" style="font-size: large;font-weight: 400;">Ride-sharing is the future of <b>mobility.</b> Yes, we often make this statement as traffic congestion is increasing day-by-day. Shared mobility is the way to go forward as the number of vehicles on the road are increasing at a rapid rate. So, what is this shared mobility all about and how it will change the way we think about the daily commute? Itâ€™s time to address the elephant in the room!

                <b>Ride-sharing</b> is nothing but sharing your private vehicle with other passengers travelling on the same route. We all know that sharing is caring and this also applies for shared mobility.
                Enjoy a better travel experience
